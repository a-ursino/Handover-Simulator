================================

Input data
--------------------
* Traffic load. The calls arrives according to a poisson process with a rate equals to traffic load
* The maximum  simulation's time


Output data
----------------------
* Total calls
* Total blocked calls
* Blocked calls probability
* Total interrupted calls
* Interrupted calls probability
